# Public-Sector-Employment-Dashboard


## 📈 Data Overview  
The project uses a **hardcoded dataset** (`jobData` array) containing:  
- Organization name  
- Job title  
- Number of vacancies  
- Employment type (Regular, Contractual, Deputation, etc.)  
- Sector (Banking, Defence, Health, Education, etc.)  
- Closing date  

## 🔧 How to Run  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `Job_Dashboard.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).  
3. Interact with filters, charts, and tables to explore job opportunities.  

## 📸 Demo Preview

## 📌 Future Improvements  
- Load real-time data from APIs instead of hardcoded arrays  
- Export job listings to CSV/Excel  
- Add pagination for large datasets  
- Include advanced filtering (salary, location, pay level)
